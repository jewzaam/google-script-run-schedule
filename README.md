This is a backup of a google script I wrote because I got tired of looking up weather forecasts and figuring out what I wanted to wear for an upcoming run.  I have since updated it to support setting only weather forecast data.  It's setup for me for what to wear for a run, so your results will vary.

A few things to note:
* Private.gs: you have to suppy your own weather underground API key
* Calendar.gs: OUTSIDE_EVENT_COLOR sets the color of an event that means it's outdoors.. modify as needed
* Calendar.gs: if the event has word "run" or "yoga" a reminder is set at 7PM the day before

This is a complete hack and I've thought about rewriting it.  But it's working for me, so will probably just stop here for now.
